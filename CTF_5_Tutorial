Attached key is Alice (we assume)
Assume we are Bob

Read values in public key: 
openssl pkey -in key.pem -text

record private key, public, modulus, and g
convert from hex to decimal
A = pow(g, private, mod) //private, Alice's private
k = hex(pow(A,5,mod)) //Im Bob, and I just got A  5 is my private key

Select all asymetric encryption algrithms and place them in the brackets of the flag (cga{}). Make sure they are in alphabetical order, all caps, no spaces and comma seperated. For example cga{A,B,C}. AES, AFFINE, DES, ELGAMAL, ENIGMA, MD5, OTP (One Time Pad), RSA, SHA1, SHA256, SHA512, TDES (Triple DES), and VIGINERE.


AES: replaced DES symmetric
md5 is a hashing algorithm: it is not a type of assymetric algo
SHA is also a hashing algorithm

CGA{ELGAMAL,RSA}
